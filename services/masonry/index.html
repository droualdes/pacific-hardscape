				We are highly trained and certified masons. We work with traditional materials, such as flagstone, stone veneer, brick and mortar, concrete, slate, granite, sandstone, limestone, and crushed gravel, as well as modern intelocking pavers and segmental wall blocks. Our building standards often exceed the professional building standards set forth by the <a href="http://www.icpi.org" target="_blank" alt="Interlocking Concrete Paving Institute">Interlocking Concrete Paving Institute (ICPI)</a>.
