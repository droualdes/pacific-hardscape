					<p>
						We design and build beautiful hardscapes such as driveways, patios, pool decks, walls, outdoor kitchens, steps, walkways, fire pits, and fire places. While our most popular building materials are interlocking pavers and segmental retaining wall blocks, as experienced and certified masons, we also build with flagstone, stone veneer, brick and mortar, concrete, slate, granite, sandstone, limestone, and crushed gravel. Complimenting our hardscaping services, we also install synthetic grass and outdoor lighting.
