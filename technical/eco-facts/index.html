				Traditional Lawns &amp; the Environment
			</h2>
			<p>
				Just look at the impact on the environment of upkeep on a traditional lawn. Synthetic grass makes environmental sense! 
			</p>
			<h3>
				Water
			</h3>
			<p>
				According to the EPA, over one-third of residential water is used for lawn irrigation nationwide, totaling over 4 billion gallons of water a day.
			</p>
			<p>
				40-60% of the nitrogen fertilizer applied to natural grass lawns ends up in surface and groundwater, leading to contamination and impaired ecological health in our rivers, lakes, ponds and coastal waters.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Pollution
			</h3>
			<p>
				According to the EPA, a traditional gas-powered lawn mower produces as much air pollution as 43 new cars driving 12,000 miles.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over 17 million gallons of gas and oil are spilled each year from refueling lawn equipment&mdash;that is more oil than was spilled by the Exxon Valdez.
