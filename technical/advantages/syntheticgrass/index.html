			<h3>
				No More Water
			</h3>
			<p>
				Synthetic Grass is the perfect solution for dramatically lowering your monthly water bill. No watering translates to savings of up to 70% on your water bill = $500 per year for the average U.S. Household.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Virtually Maintenance-Free
			</h3>
			<p>
				Never mow, weed, or fertilize your grass ever again—just enjoy it. It will stay green all year round and for years to come. About the only thing you'll need to do is blow off any surface debris such as leaves.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Kid-Friendly, Pet-Friendly, &amp; Eco-Friendly
			</h3>
			<p>
				The elimination of harmful pesticides and fertilizers makes it safe for you, kids, pets, and the environment. Plus, synthetic grass won't stain you kids clothes like natural grass does.
			</p>
			<h3>
