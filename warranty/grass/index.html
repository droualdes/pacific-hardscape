				Synthetic Grass Warranty
			</h1>
			<p>
				All synthetic grass installations come with an Installation Warranty and a Manufacturer's Warranty.
			</p>
			<h2>
				5-Year Installation Warranty
			</h2>
			<p>
				Pacific Hardscapes offers a 5-year warranty on the installation of synthetic grass. If within this warranty period, the workmanship of the installation fails to conform to our Installation Standards (shown below) or there is a defect in the synthetic grass, we will, at our discretion, choose to repair or replace the synethetic grass at our own expense.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Installation Standards
			</h3>
			<p>
				Synthetic grass is installed according to commonly accepted building practices.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Flatness
			</h4>
			<p>
				It is considered normal for synthetic grass to have minor wave-like rises and depressions. Some rippling or bubbling on putting greens is considered normal.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Drainage
			</h4>
			<p>
				After a moderate rainstorm, up to 3 inches per hour, there should be no standing water on the lawn within one hour.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Weeds
			</h4>
			<p>
				Synthetic grass is installed with a weed-free base, however, seeds can be carried by the wind and dropped onto the top of the lawn and grow from there. These type of weeds can simply be removed by hand.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Edge Restraint
			</h4>
			<p>
				A edge restraint and/or hardscape may surround the entire lawn with turf tucked under for a natural appearance.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Seems
			</h4>
			<p>
				Seams will be secure with a maximum gap of less than or equal to 1/8-inch.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Maintenance
			</h4>
			<p>
				Synthetic grass should be cleaned and groomed periodically depending on the type and frequency of use. High traffic areas of synthetic grass may require occasional professional grooming to prevent substantial matting.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Exceptions
			</h4>
			<p>
				These standards does not cover the movement of synethetic grass due to earthquakes, landslides, flooding, or other such acts of god.
			</p>
