						Synthetic Grass
					</h2>
					<h3 class="h4">
						Materials:
					</h3>
					<p>
						Our synthetic lawns are environmentally safe and contain no toxic properties.
					</p>
					<h3 class="h4">
						Installation:
					</h3>
					<p>
						Our synthetic grass is natural in appearance, but may include minor wave-like rises and depressions.
					</p>
					<p>
						After a moderate to heavy rain storm (up to 3 inches per hour), drainage should occur and there should be no standing water with our synthetic grass.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our synthetic grass is generally weed-free, however, seeds can be carried by the wind and dropped onto the grass. Simply remove these seeds by hand to keep them from growing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Synthetic Grass is low-maintenance, however, it should be cleaned and groomed periodically depending on frequency of use. High traffic areas of synthetic grass may require occasional professional grooming.
