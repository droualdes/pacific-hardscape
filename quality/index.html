				Synthetic Grass
			</h2>
			<h3 class="h4">
				Materials
			</h3>
			<p>
				Our synthetic lawns are environmentally safe and contain no toxic properties.
			</p>
			<h3 class="h4">
				Installation
			</h3>
			<p>
				Our synthetic grass is natural in appearance, but may include minor wave-like rises and depressions.
			</p>
			<p>
				After a moderate to heavy rain storm (up to 3-inches per hour), drainage should occur and there should be no standing water with our synthetic grass.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our synthetic grass is generally weed-free, however, seeds can be carried by the wind and dropped onto the grass. Simply remove these seeds by hand to keep them from growing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Synthetic Grass is low-maintenance, however, it should be cleaned and groomed periodically depending on frequency of use. High traffic areas of synthetic grass may require occasional professional grooming.
