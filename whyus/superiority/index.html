				Superiority
			</h1>
			<p>
				There are two reasons people use us: superior service and superior building practices. We can toute our superior service all day long, but to be honest, you will have to rely on what our existing happy customers have to say about us. With regard to superior building practices, we illustrate you step by step  .

				We can toute our superior service all day long, but to be honest, you will have to rely on what our existing happy customers have to say about us. You can either check out our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/testimonials" alt="Testimonials">testimonials</a> page or visit <a href="http://www.yelp.com" target="_blank" alt="Yelp">Yelp</a> to do your research.

			<h2>
				Superior Building Practices
			</h2>
			<p>
				Our driveways are simply built to the highest standards&mdash;ensuring years of trouble-free happiness. In fact, our building standards often exceed the professional building standards set forth by the <a href="http://www.icpi.org" target="_blank" alt="Interlocking Concrete Paving Institute">Interlocking Concrete Paving Institute (ICPI)</a>.

				Our Step-by-Step Pavers Installation Process

			</div>
			<h4>
				Excavation
			</h4>
			<p>
				Excavation involves removing the existing ground material. We use Bobcat tractors whenever possible, but use good old fashion hard labor is often used for areas inaccessible to heavy equipment. For patios and walkways, we typically excavate down about 8 inches. For driveways, we typically excavate down about 12 inches.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Soil Preparing 
			</h4>
			<p>
				This stage involves preparing soil subgrade and base. This is one of the most important elements of the job. Soil subgrade and base preparation involves 70% or more of the labor in most jobs. When complete, it allows the base to distribute the loads and stresses from above.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Soil Compaction
			</h4>
			<p>
				We compact the soil for four reasons: to increases its load-bearing strength; to prevent pavement settlement/rutting; to reduce seasonal movement; to allow for uniform movement. Soild compaction minimizes deformation and/or heaving of the paved surface during freezing or thawing.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Soil Grading
			</h4>
			<p>
				For proper drainage, the contractor will slope the paved area away from the house at a minimum of 2%.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Geotextiles (optional)
			</h4>
			<p>
				Geotextiles are special fabrics recommended for use in circumstance such as clay or silt soil types and highly saturated soils. The fabric keeps fine soils from migrating upward into the base material.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Base Thickness
			</h4>
			<p>
				The base thickness below the pavers is crucial to a proper, long lasting pavers installation. This is often where our competitors cheat in order to save money. Pacific Pavers &amp; Stone follows <a href="http://www.icpi.org" target="_blank" alt="Interlocking Concrete Paving Institute">ICPI (Interlocking Concrete Paving Institute)</a> guidelines for minimum base thickness on different applications. For instane, for patios and walkways, our base thickness is a minimum of 4-inches thick. For driveways, where heavy loads from cars are expected, our base a minimum of 6-8-inches thick. Your contractor should know the technical requirements for base thickness that apply to your particular installation.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Restraint Perimeter Pavers
			</h4>
			<p>
				We embed the perimeter of your pavers in concrete, thus holding your pavers in place for the life of the pavement. This also eliminating horizontal creeping of the pavers and loss of bedding sand. This is another area where our competitors cheat in order to save money. Our competitors often use flexible plastic edge restraints instead of concrete, which are inferior to concrete as they often move over time.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Bedding Sand
			</h4>
			<p>
				Sand is installed over the base to a consistent thicknessâ€”between .75-inch and 1.5-inch according to ICPI guidelines.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Initial Paver Compaction
			</h4>
			<p>
				Once pavers are laid into the base sand, the pavers are compacted to interlock them in the base sand. We then sweep a finish coat of sand until the paver joints are completely full. Another compaction is done to fully lock the pavers in place.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Secondary Paver Compaction with Finish Sand
			</h4>
			<p>
				There are two types of finish sand that can be used between paver joints: a regular grade sand and a polymeric sand. Although slightly higher in prices, the polymeric sand is recommended as it binds together to form a seal between the pavers, which helps prevent weeds from appear between the pavers over time.
			</p>
			<p>
				We compacted the pavers without joint sand to interlock them in the base sand. Then we sweep dry joint sand until the paver joints are completely full. Compaction is done once again to fully lock the pavers in place.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Paver Sealing (optional)
			</h4>
			<p>
				We can optionally seal your pavers, which may enhance the colors and can prevent certain stains. Due to technical reasons, we need a minimum of 60-90 days after completion of the installation before sealing can be applied.
