				Segmental Retaining Walls Advantages
			</h2>
			<p>
				Pacific Pavers and Stone has the experience and wisdom of thousands of installations under their belts. Our installers are professionally trained and certified in proper installation techniques. We only recommend products that pass our high-quality standards.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Strength &amp; Durability
			</h3>
			<p>
				Segmental Retaining Wall Blocks are engineered to be 4X stronger than concrete. In addition, these blocks will not crack like concrete—even in harsh weather conditions.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Cost-Effective
			</h3>
			<p>
				Installing a segmental retaining wall is one of the least expensive ways to build a retaining wall. It makes both short- and long-term economic sense. Plus, the lifespan of a segmental retaining wall can last up to 75-100 years.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Choice, Choices, Choices
			</h3>
			<p>
				Limitless design possibilities exist with segmental retaining wall blocks. Selections include a variety of styles, colors, shapes, and textures.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Subsurface Repairs
			</h3>
			<p>
				Just remove the necessary blocks to repair a broken pipe or tree root pushing on the wall and put them back when you are done making repairs. That’s impossible to do with a concrete retaining wall. There’s no loss of investment as the segmental retaining wall blocks are reused.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Earthquake Performance
			</h3>
			<p>
				In the event of an Earthquake, segmental retaining wall blocks can be reused if displaced, thus minimizing any loss of investment. This make segmental retaining walls the perfect solution for those living in California.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Outstanding Warranty
			</h3>
			<p>
				Pacific Pavers and Stone stands behind our segmental retaining wall installations with a Lifetime manufacturer’s warranty on blocks and a 5-year warranty on installation. Rest assured, a segmental retaining wall installation by Pacific Pavers and Stone is a worry-free investment that will provide enjoyment for years to come.
